# dice_roll
Dice rolling game using Kotlin. 
Using Kotlin, I created a Dice Run using Kotlin. Using the following concepts -
1. Kotlin variables
2. Functions
3. String Templates
4. Standard Library Functions
Below are the specifications of the program : 

i) Application Name: Dice Run
The application simulates a dice throw. It prompts the user for their name to personalise the experience.

ii) Welcome Message:
The program greets the players by their name and welcomes them into the world of Dice Run.

iii) Dice Roll Simulation:
Program to generate random numbers from 1 to 6 to simulate a dice throw and display this number as the result of the dice throw.

iv) Rolling Delay:
Program to simulate a short delay of 1 second to create suspense before revealing the dice result and keeping players on the edge of their seats.

v) Player Interaction:
Program that prompts the user to enter their name. The name entered by the user is saved in a variable and that variable is further used to generate customised messages to the user.

vi) Output:
Program displaying the result of the dice throw along with a welcome message.

vii) Simulation of Dice Throw:
Program that uses a range of numbers from 1 to 6 to simulate a standard six-sided dice.

viii) Termination:
After displaying the result, the program execution terminates.
